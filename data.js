      `The Innovation Lab presented the idea for this application, and my team and I spent 20 weeks researching, designing, and 
      coding this project. I was one of the two lead developers on this project, responsible for bringing the research and design 
      team's ideas to life on this cross-platform, user-friendly application.
      Task completion was validated using image recognition utilizing Google Vision's API. Some features included: 
      creation of routines & activities, dropdown menus with autofill, image and video embedding, deletion, 
      duplication, and modification available on activities, routines and rewards, the ability to add custom labels to routines, 
      two user interfaces - one for children and one for parents.`,

      `Virtual Help is an online tutoring solution for connecting students with TAs to get assistance on the project.  
      I led my team in creating this system for a UCI Professor that wanted a solution for accomodating the tutoring needs of students  
      with the virtual limitations presented by COVID-19. The system allows students to select their course, describe their issues, attach  
      files, and even input formatted code in a special code-friendly text box on our UI. Tutors can see all open requests in order of submission  
      select the one they choose to assist with, and the student is then notified of the pending session. The student has 60 seconds to accept the  
      session, and upon acceptance, both the student and the tutor are directed to a private Zoom meeting to address the student's questions.  
      The application allows TAs and students to see their session histories, and students can re-submit previously closed or missed sessions  
      through their history UI. Students can also rate their session and submit an explanation for the rating upon the session closing. 
      The application does everything in real-time, and addresses both success and failure scenarios for pairing students with TAs.  
      Additionally, a CMS system allows the application's control to lie in the hands of administrators, who are able to adjust user permissions  
      and availble courses that can be addressed on the application.`,

      `This idea came to my teammate and I during a hackathon. We wanted a solution for group 
      scheduling that solved the problems the current popular systems presented.
      Between friends and clubs, there are a lot of events to organize, each with its own set of
      different schedules to consider. The current solution is to use a site called when2meet where
      the user must manually copy over their availability from their own calendar for each event.   
      While functional, the process can be frustrating and repetitive, which is why we came up with  
      Scheduley, a group availability site that imports personal Google Calendar information.
      Scheduley allows each user to fill out a shared calendar using their own linked Google Calendar account, 
      and a color-coded group schedule is created detailing when each person on the shared link 
      is available. New members can access and add their calendar by simply entering the calendar 
      name and password. Because Scheduley relies on Google Calendar information rather than user input, the user
      will never have to re-enter their availability for any group they join.`,
